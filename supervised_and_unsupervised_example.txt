Supervised Learning:
        the model learns from dataset which has labeled data with input features and corresponding labeled output.
        in simple terms a model which learns from labeled data with example and there output. this learning is called
        Supervised Learning.

    Example of Supervised Learning:
        Email spam detection via labeled data,
        House price prediction via labeled data

    Example of labeled dataset (for spam email detection):
        Text,               Label
        "Buy now!",         Spam
        "Meeting at 3PM",   Not Spam

Unsupervised Learning:
        the model learns from patterns from data without labeled outputs
        in simple terms a model which learns without any formatted/labeled examples, this learning is called Unsupervised Learning.

    Example of Unsupervised Learning:
        Customer Segmentation,
        Anomaly Detection in Transactions

    Example of Unsupervised dataset:
        Text
        "Buy now!"
        "Meeting at 3PM"
